 Predictive Modeling(ml step)
Machine Learning Models: Experiment with various machine learning models to predict future returns or price movements. Models can range from traditional ones like ARIMA, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks), to more complex deep learning models.
Evaluation: Use appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE for regression tasks, accuracy for classification, etc.) to evaluate model performance. Also, consider the specific nature of financial returns and risk (e.g., Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown) in your evaluation.
5. Optimization Algorithm
Dynamic Allocation: Implement an optimization algorithm that can adjust allocations dynamically based on the predictive models' outputs. Techniques such as the Kelly Criterion, Mean-Variance Optimization, or even more sophisticated machine learning-driven methods could be applied.
Risk Management: Incorporate measures to manage risk, such as setting maximum exposure limits to specific assets, incorporating stop-loss strategies, or using derivatives for hedging.
6. Backtesting
Simulation: Backtest your optimized portfolio against historical data to evaluate its performance over time, considering transaction costs, slippage, and other real-world factors.
Adjustment: Refine your models and strategies based on backtesting results. This iterative process is crucial to enhancing the robustness of your optimization system.
7. Deployment and Monitoring
Real-Time Data Pipeline: Develop a system for real-time data ingestion and prediction to ensure your portfolio can respond swiftly to market changes.
Monitoring System: Implement a monitoring system to track the performance of your portfolio and the accuracy of your predictive models, allowing for timely adjustments.
